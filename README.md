# 🌡️ UTCI-Based Heat Stress Risk Index Forecast – MERN Stack 🌍

This project is a research-backed, real-time web application built using the **MERN stack** that forecasts **heat stress risk levels** based on **UTCI (Universal Thermal Climate Index)**. Designed in collaboration with IIT Roorkee, the application aims to help citizens, researchers, and policy makers understand and monitor heat stress conditions effectively.

> 🚀 Powered by MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js.

## 🔬 What is UTCI?

The **Universal Thermal Climate Index (UTCI)** is a globally recognized indicator for human thermal stress. It accounts for:
- Air Temperature 🌡️
- Humidity 💧
- Wind Speed 🌬️
- Radiation ☀️

This project converts environmental inputs into UTCI values and categorizes the risk level from **no stress** to **extreme heat stress**.
